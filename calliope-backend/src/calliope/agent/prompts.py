=== HARD CONSTRAINTS (non-negotiable) ===
1. The JSON field "scenes" MUST contain EXACTLY {scene_n} objects.
2. order_index must run 1, 2, 3, ... {scene_n} with no gaps.
3. Do NOT collapse back to fewer scenes. The user expanded the script to {scene_n} clips — fill all of them.
4. Sum of duration_sec across all scenes should be approximately {secs} (within ±15%).
5. duration_sec is an editorial recommendation, not a constant: vary it intentionally between {min_scene_duration_sec} and {max_scene_duration_sec} seconds based on action complexity, dialogue, reveals, reaction beats, and transitions.
6. Do not force a single average duration. Use the full range deliberately: short transitions can be near the minimum, ordinary beats can be in the middle, and major reveals, dialogue, or sustained actions may use the upper range. Spread the beat arc across all {scene_n} scenes.

=== ACTION DETAIL (this text IS the video prompt — users copy it straight into the generator) ===
Each scene's "action" is fed verbatim to an AI video generator. Write 4–6 vivid present-tense
sentences (~80–130 words) per scene as ONE flowing natural-English paragraph — no bullet points,
no labeled fragments (do NOT write "Shot:", "Lighting:", etc.), no line breaks. Rules:
1. ONE SHOT PER SCENE. A clip is only {duration_hint} seconds — describe a single continuous
   camera setup with at most one simple action beat (one entrance, one gesture, one reveal).
   If a beat needs more room, split it across multiple scenes instead of compressing it.
2. SHOT & MOTION. Name the framing and camera move (wide establishing, slow push-in, handheld
   tracking, low angle, rack focus) AND what visibly moves in frame — video models need motion:
   gestures, turning heads, hair and fabric, drifting dust, sweeping flashlight beams, an
   expression shifting. A static description produces a static clip.
3. CHARACTER ANCHORS. The first time each character appears in a scene, attach a 3–8 word
   visual anchor taken from their description above (hair, outfit, one distinguishing
   feature), e.g. "MIA, a teenage girl with a chestnut ponytail and yellow rain jacket,".
   Later mentions in the same scene use the plain name. Never invent new appearance details —
   reuse these anchors so every clip matches the same face and wardrobe.
4. ENVIRONMENT & CONTINUITY. Concrete set details, props, weather, time-of-day — consistent
   with the location description and with earlier scenes set in the same location.
5. LIGHTING & MOOD. Named light sources, color palette, emotional tone of the moment.
Describe only what is VISIBLE (no inner thoughts; no sounds or music — dialogue covers audio).
Vary shot types across scenes — do not write {scene_n} identical wide shots.

=== DIALOGUE ===
Keep lines short and natural. When delivery matters for performance, add a brief cue in
parentheses after the speaker name, e.g. "MIA (whispering): line" or "LIAM (hushed, excited): line".

Respond ONLY with JSON:
{{
  "scenes": [

She freezes mid-step, fingers tightening on the lantern handle as she looks up. Overturned desks and a collapsed chalkboard fill the frame; moonlight cuts through shattered windows in pale blue shafts.
